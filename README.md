==========

Miscellaneous JS stuff created when toying around with things...

* _: despites the folder name, this is not underscore; this contains mn.js, a small happy library used by samples which don't (want to) depend on any framework
* __circles__: a bunch of circles running on HTML5 canvases
* __bouncing (new)__: circles with a touch of physics
* __todos__: plain vanilla JS implementation of [TodoMVC](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/)
* __notes__: single page note app
    * _Server side_: Node, Express, MongoDB
    * _Client side_: multiple implementations (Sammy and Backbone)

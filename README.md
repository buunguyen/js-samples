JavaScript Samples
==========

This is a collection of JavaScript samples I code when learning things.
I will keep adding more samples as I continue playing with these.

* _: small, happy library used by samples which don't (want to) depend on any framework
* __circles__: a bunch of circles running on HTML5 canvases
* __todos__: another plain vanilla JS implementation of [TodoMVCs](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/)
* __notes__: single page note app
    * _Server side_: Node, Express, MongoDB
    * _Client side_: multiple implementations (Sammy, Backbone and soon Knockout)
